### Wilcoxon Wars
Inspired by [Fagerland (2012)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-12-78), I did a series of simulations comparing a t-test and a Wilcoxon rank sum test under various conditions were assumptions for the t-test are violated. You can find a summary of the simulation results [here](https://einglasrotwein.github.io/wilcoxon_wars.html).

### Benford's Unicorn
A little script for creating an example of Benford's Law - along with a plot including a flying unicorn. There's a version with pink bars and one with rainbow bars.
